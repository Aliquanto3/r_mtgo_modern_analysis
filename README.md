# r_mtgo_modern_analysis
Repository for the development of programs in R to analyse the MTGO Modern Metagame.

3 different R programs are available:
- 1 for the parameters;
- 1 for the body of the code;
- 1 for the generation of the results.

How to use?

A - Open the MTGO_comp_results_analysis-PARAMETERS.R program.
Update the parameters as you like (as long as they remain valid).
Run the program.

B - Run the MTGO_comp_results_analysis-DATA-TREATMENT.R program.

C - Open the MTGO_comp_results_analysis-RESULTS-GENERATION.R program. 
Choose a function and run it to get the graph you are looking for.

D - You can go back to step A - to update the parameters, and run a new function afterwards with new parameters.
If you know which parameters you want to change, you can also just update their value in the console instead.
Some parameters change might require you to run step B - again as well, when it means changing the data.
